**PART1: INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING**
  1. **Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry**
    - Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software using engineering principles
       - **Importance of Software Engineering**
         - saves on development costs
         - ensures scalability
         - saves on time
         - ensures on quality stuff is pushed to prod
           
      
  2. **Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering**
   
      - 1968: The Birth of Software Engineering which addressed the lack of a well-structured development approach
      - 1970s: Introduction of the Waterfall Model by Winston Royce which offered a step by step approach for development
      - 2001: The Agile Manifesto which fixed a few issues with the waterfall model
      

  4. **List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle**
      - planning – define project goals, scope, and feasibility
      - requirements analysis – gather and document user needs
      - design – create architecture ui and database structures
      - implementation – write and develop the software
      - testing – identify and fix bugs to ensure quality
      - deployment – push the software to production
      - maintenance – provide updates and fix issues over time
      

  5. **Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate**
      - **waterfall**
         - linear, rigid, detailed planning, feedback at the end, hard to change, full delivery at once
      - **agile**
         - iterative, flexible, continuous planning, frequent feedback, easy to change, small releases
      - **when to use which**
         - use waterfall for fixed-scope projects like banking or government systems
         - use agile for dynamic projects like mobile apps or startups
     
      
  6. **Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team**
      - software developer – writes code, implements features, fixes bugs, and optimizes performance
      - quality assurance engineer – tests software, finds bugs, ensures quality, and improves reliability
      - project manager – plans tasks, manages timelines, coordinates teams, and ensures project success

  7. **Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each**
      - ides: ides provide tools like code editing, debugging, and automation to improve productivity examples: vscode, intellij idea, pycharm
      - version control systems: tracks code changes, enables collaboration, and prevents data loss

  8. **Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance**
      - unit testing – tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly
      - integration testing – checks if different modules work together as expected
      - system testing – evaluates the entire system to verify it meets requirements
      - acceptance testing – ensures the software meets user needs before release



**PART2: INTRODUTION TO AI AND PROMPT ENGINEERING**

  1. **Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models**
       - prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective queries to get accurate and useful responses from ai models
         - **importance**
             - improves response quality and relevance
             - helps ai understand complex queries
             - enhances efficiency in automation and ai applications
             - enables better control over ai-generated content

               
  2. **Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective**
     - **vague prompt**
          "Tell me about technology."
       
     - **improved prompt**
          "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on cybersecurity in 200 words."
       
     - **why it's better**
       - clear – specifies the focus on ai and cybersecurity
       - specific – defines the scope, avoiding a broad response
       - concise – sets a word limit for a focused answer
