--  INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
  - **Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry**
    - Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software using engineering principles
       - **Importance of Software Engineering**
         - saves on development costs
         - ensures scalability
         - saves on time
         - ensures on quality stuff is pushed to prod
           
      
  - **Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering**
    - 1968: The Birth of Software Engineering which addressed the lack of a well-structured development approach
    - 1970s: Introduction of the Waterfall Model by Winston Royce which offered a step by step approach for development
    - 2001: The Agile Manifesto which fixed a few issues with the waterfall model
      

  - **List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle**
    - planning – define project goals, scope, and feasibility
    - requirements analysis – gather and document user needs
    - design – create architecture ui and database structures
    - implementation – write and develop the software
    - testing – identify and fix bugs to ensure quality
    - deployment – push the software to production
    - maintenance – provide updates and fix issues over time
      

  - **Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate**
    - waterfall
       - linear, rigid, detailed planning, feedback at the end, hard to change, full delivery at once
    - agile
       - iterative, flexible, continuous planning, frequent feedback, easy to change, small releases
    - when to use which
       - use waterfall for fixed-scope projects like banking or government systems
       - use agile for dynamic projects like mobile apps or startups
     
      
  - **Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team**
    - software developer – writes code, implements features, fixes bugs, and optimizes performance
    - quality assurance engineer – tests software, finds bugs, ensures quality, and improves reliability
    - project manager – plans tasks, manages timelines, coordinates teams, and ensures project success
